# Command line arguments with sysargv and argparse 
## This programme contains two python scripts
#### 1. A script that tests out the command line with the sys.argv method
#### 2. A script that tests out the command line with the argparse method

### The outcome for both scripts
* Both scripts handle the -help or -h command
* Both scripts will also handle other flags like:
    *   python version ie; --version, -V
    *   verbose ie; -v, -vv
